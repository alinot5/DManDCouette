# DManD Couette

This repo contains the data-driven manifold dynamics (DManD) model described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04638. Here we provide POD modes for minimal flow unit turbulent Couette flow at Re=400, a hybrid autoencoder that reduces the dimension down to 18 degrees of freedom, and a neural ODE that evolves this 18 dimensional system.
